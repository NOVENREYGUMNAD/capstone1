   <h5>LGU Maco Website</h5>
  <p>"One of my initial projects, during the early stages of my journey as a full-stack web developer, was creating a website for the LGU Maco in the province of Davao de Oro. I completed this project in just two months. Reflecting on it now, I'm filled with nostalgia for the excitement and joy I felt while coding it."

<h5>edx Online School</h5>
  <p>"Similar to many other websites, this platform is a valuable resource for both students and out-of-school youth. I firmly believe that creating more websites like this can provide opportunities for everyone, regardless of whether they are in school or not, as long as they have access to the internet and a device."</p>
